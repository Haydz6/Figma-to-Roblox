This is not the best code as it was written over the past week or so :)

```
Running your own server proxy:
    1) Make sure you have node and npm installed
    2) Download this repository and extract it, and open it up once you have
    3) Open cmd in the current directory and run 'npm install'
    4) and then run 'npm start'
    5) Copy the url (in green text) and paste it into the 'Custom Proxy' field in the FtR ui
```
